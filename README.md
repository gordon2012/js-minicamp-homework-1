### Variables
- A variable is a container that points to a location in the computer's memory that values can be placed in for future use. In Javascript, variables are weakly typed, meaning they can change types dynamically and the compiler infers the current type based on the value being stored.

### Strings
- A string is a variable type that contains a 'string' of text or characters. Javascript strings contain many built in properties and methods such as length to find out how long a string is, split() to turn it into an array of 'substrings', and concat() to combine two strings together.

### Functions (arguments, `return`)
- Functions are very important in Javascript, they are first class citizens. They allow one to store logic to be used at a later or multiple times. Functions can be stored in variables and they can even be anonymous. They take arguments that are passed in when called to be used inside their body, and they can return a value.

### `if` statements
- An if statement is a branch in the logic of a program where a decision is made. The block is executed if the boolean statement evaluates to true, and the optional else block executes if it is false.

### Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
- Boolean variables are either true or false. They are the return value of many statements and functions and fuel many statements such as the if statement.
